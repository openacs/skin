    <h2>The Skin Demo</h2>
    <p>
      Master pages (sometimes called "master templates") can define a
      look that several pages share.  They wrap themselves around the
      main or "slave" page, like a skin.  If the master page isn't
      specified, the default master of the closest ancestor of type
      acs-subsite in the site map applies.  This allows different
      per-subsite skins around common pages.  That's also called
      "cobranding".  The purpose of the "skin" package is to
      demonstrate with a <em>primitive</em> example how
      acs-templating supports this.
    </p>

    <h3>Installaion</h3>
    <p>
      To get the subsite demo on your server, you need to perform the
      following steps manually.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
	Obtain the <code>skin</code> package.  (At that point you can
	read this documentation as <code>/doc/skin</code> on your
	server.)
      </li>
      <li>
	Mount it on /skin.
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Go to <a href="/admin/site-map">/admin/site-map</a> on
	    your server.
	  </li>
	  <li>In the first row, "Main Site", follow "new sub
	    folder".</li>
	  <li>Type "skin" in the box.</li>
	  <li>Click "New".</li>
	  <li>In the new row, "skin", follow "mount"</li>
	  <li>
	    You'll find "Skin" at the bottom, under the centraized
	    services, which are usually not meant to be mounted.
	    Mount it (follow the link) anyway.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      <li>
	Create subsite "Curly" with another "api-doc"
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    You should still be at <a href = "/admin/site-map"
	    >/admin/site-map</a>.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Add another "new sub folder" to the "Main Site" as
	    "curly".  Make it a "new application" called "Curly";
	    leave the application "ACS Subsite"
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Add a "new sub folder" to "Curly" as "api-doc".  Follow
	    "mount", then from the middle block (instances already
	    mounted elsewhere) follow "ACS API Browser" to create
	    another location.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>
	Set different skins for subsites "/" and "/curly"
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    In the top row "Main Site", follow "set parameters"
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Scroll to the bottom and change parameter "DefaultMaster"
	    to "/packages/skin/master/straight".  (The "straight" skin
	    features a logo.  It is hardcoded for simplicity, but
	    could be another parameter of subsite, or looked up in a
	    table.)
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Click "Set Parameters" to submit your change.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Repeat the above steps for node "/curly", setting
	    "DefaultMaster" to "/packages/skin/master/curly"
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>
	Notice how these skins change the look of familiar pages:
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    <a href="/">/</a> and <a href="/curly/">/curly/</a>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <a href="/pvt/home">/pvt/home</a> and <a
	      href="/curly/pvt/home">/curly/pvt/home</a>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <a href="/api-doc">/api-doc</a> and <a
	      href="/curly/api-doc">/curly/api-doc</a>
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    <a href="/admin">/admin</a> and <a
	      href="/curly/admin">/curly/admin</a>
	  </li>
	</ul>
    </ul>
